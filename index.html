                        <ul>
                            <li>You will get nearer to God by ABIDING by the PRECEPTS of the Book of Mormon, than by any other book. Not by just reading it.</li>
                           <li>Having a purpose while reading the Book of Mormon is almost as important as reading the Book of Mormon.</li>
                           <li>I can receive power to resist temptation and deception when I seriouslly study the Book of Mormon.</li>
                           <li>We should remind ourselves constantly not to compare.</li>
                           <li>Sometimes I should ask myself "what should I not be doing?".</li>
                           <li>I can always have a prayer in my heart. Especially while traveling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi" ><div class="nephi extra">Plan of Salvation</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"The study of true doctrine will improve behavior quicker than the study of behavior will improve behavior" - Packer</li>
                            <li>The purpose of the plan is not only to get somewhere, but to become something as well.</li>
                            <li>On the day of judgement it will not be God holding us back from his presence, but our own guilt and shame if we have not repented and made changes in our lives.</li>
                            <li>The Atonement of Jesus Christ covers both the physical and spiritual death we all experience. I still need to do my best in overcoming my carnal nature but Jesus Christ will be with me every step of the way.</li>
                            <li>Jesus Christ will do all he can to help us return to Heavenly Father it is up to us and our desires on whether we will make it or not.</li>

                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">What is Translation?</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Things are always lost in translation.</li>
                           <li>Joseph Smith used a seer stone for a majority of the translation.</li>
                           <li>Translation means to carry one across. So carrying over meaning from one language to another.</li>
                           <li>Tight translation is taking everything literal word for word.</li>
                           <li>Loose translation is taking your own understanding into the translation. Taking phrases or words from the past and replacing it a phrase people would understand today.</li>
                           <li>Translator must find a balance between accuracy and appropiateness or tight and loose translation.</li>
                           <li>There are multiple editions of the Book of Mormon in which changes have been made. A majority of those changes were to improve grammar.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">What Are the Plates?</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nephi had two sets of plates. One being larger where he kept the history and events of his people. The other being smaller where he wrote things that were sacred. The smaller plates is what we have in our Book of Mormon today.</li>
                            <li>While the book of Lehi was lost to wicked men, the Lord had prepared for that many years before through his prophets Nephi and Mormon.</li>
                            <li>A large portion of the gold plates were sealed, and we still do not have access to them today.</li>
                            <li>After the small plates of Nephi the rest of the Book of Mormon is primarily the writing of Mormon summarizing and telling the most important events in Nephite history.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h2 class="section-heading">Unit 3</h2>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Exegesis and Eisegsis</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Hermeneutics is the study of how humans interpret sacred text.</li>
                           <li>Exegesis is what the original writer was trying to convey when he wrote it. Understanding the background and society of those who wrote the text is important in exegesis.</li>
                           <li>Eisegesis is how the reader interprets and applies the text to their life.</li></li>
                           <li>Not having the context or full picture can be dangerous while trying to understand scripture.</li>
                           <li>Eisegesis can be a powerful tool and one that prophets old and new use.</li>
                           <li>Exegesis is important to understand because it helps us to understand why certain things were included and the order in which they were written.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Finding Patterns</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Through the combination of Eisgesis and Exegesis we can receive understanding for our day while still remembering the original intent.</li>
                            <li>The Book of Mormon authors saw our day so we should keep that in mind as we study the words and stories they chose to keep.</li>
                            <li>There are three questions I can ask myself as I read each verse in the Book of Mormon</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Are there precepts in this story that could help me “get nearer to God” if I abide by them, as Joseph Smith said?</li>
                                <li>Why would the Lord inspire the author to include this story in his record? What lesson can I learn from this story to help me live my life today?</li>
                                <li>Are there embedded messages in this story, as President Eyring said there would be?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>I should always search for themes as I read the scriptures.</li>

                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">The Fall</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>"Before we can understand the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we must first understand the Fall. Before we can understand the Fall we have to understand the creation." - President Nelson</li>
                           <li>Without properly understanding the fall we will not completely understand why the Atonement of Jesus Christ was necessary.</li>
                           <li>Without the fall there could have been no sin, death, or children.</li>
                           <li>All of our difficulties and trials can be consecrated for our gain when we trust in Jesus Christ.</li>
                           <li>Everyone expereinced physical and spiritual death because of Adam and Eve. Through the Atonement Jesus Christ has saved us from this physical and spiritual death brought on by the fall.</li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Atonement</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Atonement means to bring two different things together into a unity.</li>
                            <li>Redemption is part of the atonement that overcomes our sins. Ressurection is the part of the atonement that overcomes the physical death.</li>
                            <li>The word atonement is used 24 times in the Book of Mormon.</li>
                            <li>In the Book of Mormon the word atonement refers to everything that Jesus does to make us one with the Father.</li>
                            <li>The atonement of Jesus Christ is not condition, but it is proffered. It does not have limits, but we do need to accept it.</li>
                         </ul>
                         <h2 class="section-heading">Unit 5</h2>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Covenants</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>President Nelson has said that one of the most important concepts of revealed religion is that of sacred covenants.</li>
                           <li>I can return to my Heavenly Father through covenants with Him and the atonement of Jesus Christ.</li>
                           <li>We believe that the first covenants that we made were in the premortal life.</li>
                           <li>A covenant is a binding agreement between God and humans in which God sets the terms.</li>
                           <li>The blessings that come from the covenant are acutally the means to fufill God's work, not simply to rewards for good behavior.</li>
                           <li>One responsibility of the Abrahamic covenant is to perform missionary work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Agency</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I can always take responisbility for my current situation. I can always choose to react in the best way possible.</li>
                            <li>While I can make my own choices, I can't choose my consequences.</li>
                            <li>"It will not do to pretend that our agency has been taken away when we are not free to exercise it without unwelcome consequences." - President Oaks</li>
                            <li>There must be opposition in all things so that I can grow and make choices.</li>
                            <li>Central to God's plan is our agency in which he wants us to choose to follow him with our own gree will.</li>
                         </ul>

                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Baptism</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Baptism is the third step in the gospel of Jesus Christ</li>
                           <li>Jesus Christ was baptized to show the Father His obedience in keeping the commandments, to fufill all righteousness, and to set an example.</li>
                           <li>One definition of repent is to change one's mind. I love this definition as I think of repentance as a change in desire.</li>
                           <li>The baptismal covenant is to serve God, keep His commandments, and be a witness of Him.</li>
                           <li>When I was baptized I took on the name of Jesus Christ. Meaning that I should do my best to be an example of Him.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Revelation</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Revelation is the way in which Heavenly Father communicates His will to His children.</li>
                            <li>I like Nephi can receive revelation when I don't understand a doctrine or principle in the church. I should not put limitations on what God can or cannot reveal to me.</li>
                            <li>There are multiple ways in which Heavenly Father reveals things to us. I should seek to understand the way in which he communicates with me.</li>
                            <li>The translation of the Book of Mormon is a modern day example of revelation. With the use of the Urim and Thummim Joseph Smith received and translated the Book of Mormon through revelation.</li>
                            <li>The Holy Ghost is fundamental in receiving revelation.</li>
                         </ul>

                        <ul>
                           <li>Stories help us connect with the people that are in them. They allow us to place ourselves in their situation and take parts of the story and apply it to our lives.</li>
                           <li>Some other ways that stories help as listed in the lesson is that they help explain human action, explain human consciousness, and to make meaning out of chaos.</li>
                           <li>Nephi when he broke his bow could have found food on his own. Instead he went to Lehi to remind him of his calling and help him to be who he could by asking for his help.</li>
                           <li>As I read I would like to focus more on the plot and the things going on in the background. Somtimes I forget that Nephi's family journeyed for 8 years because the book just mentions it briefly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="post-title nephi"><div class="nephi extra">Visitation of Christ</div></h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One of the first things that Jesus Christ did when he came to the Americas was support his prophets. By saying "I am He who the prophets testified would come."</li>
                            <li>Signs allow people an oppurtunity to practice agency and they encourage people to repent and turn to God.</li>
                            <li>Satan is a master at diminishing the importance of signs. After the signs of Jesus's birth Satan got in the hearts of the people and conviced many of them it was nothing.</li>
                            <li>I want to never waste an opportunity to come unto Christ. He has stated many times that he is waiting with his arms open and I never want to leave him hanging.</li>
                            <li>"Pride was the key that gave Satan access to the Nephites' hearts"</li>
                         </ul>

                        <ul>
                           <li>At the time of King Benjamin's speach he was not talking to a unified people.</li>
                           <li>The Nephites met up with the Mulekites in Zarehemla where Benjamin became king over all of the people because of the Nephite society and the brass plates. Even so the Nephites were smaller and foreigners.</li>
                           <li>King Benjamin's speach was most likely given on the day of Atonement. They know this because he uses the Lord's name ten times throughout his speech.</li>
                           <li>Many of the things that were said in the speech are simular to what we do in the temple.</li>

                            <li>Nephi was aware that the Book of Mormon would reach us in the last days. What he wrote was for us and is of great importance.</li>
                            <li>Nephi teaches us how we understand the teachings of Isaiah.</li>
                            <li>Nephi like all prophets before and after him testifies of Christ.</li>
                            <li>"The ultimate ant-Christ is Satan himself"</li>
                            <li>Through the Book of Mormon I can better understand the tactics of Satan and how we tries to trick us in the latter days.</li>
                            <li>Satan's favorite strategy is whatever works.</li>

                        <ul>
                           <li>While teaching the people in Americas Jesus would quote one of his prophets and then say it again, but changing the words. Drawing attention to what he wanted to teach and also supporting his prophets.</li>
                           <li>Some scriptures prepare us for other scriptures. Like having milk before you can have meat when you are born.</li>
                           <li>The Nephite people were very simular to the people in Isaiah and Malachi in that they were forsaken and they needed to repent. They both needed to enter into a covenant with God to be protected.</li>

                            <li>Reading is different than receiving. In order to receive I need to read and actively pursue an answer.</li>
                            <li>There are several conditions on Moroni's promise. One of the biggest is that we need to read the Book of Mormon.</li>
                            <li>I can receive an answer from the Holy Ghost if I put in the work and effort to do my part. If it be God's will I will receive an answer to what I am seeking.</li>
                            <li>Our Heavenly Father wants to bless us with spiritual gifts. They are His attributes and He wants us to be like Him.</li>
                            <li>Without charity we can't have hope, and without hope we cannot have faith. Faith is an attribute of charity.</li>

                        <ul>
                           <li>Scripture is revelation from God received by his prophets. In accordance with other scripture that has been received.</li>
                           <li>My understanding of the same scripture can change as I get older and have different experiences and trials.</li>
                           <li>The brass plates were not only scripture for the Nephites. They helped them maintain their language and more importantly the law of Moses.</li>
                           <li>With how much information was available to Mormon I can know that the most sacred and important events and teachings were included in the Book of Mormon.</li>
                           <li>I am going to focus on reading the Book of Mormon like scripture instead of as a history book.</li>

                            <li>Ontology is the study of being. Such as who God is and if he is a spirit or a person of flesh and bones.</li>
                            <li>Epistemology is the study of knowledge and how we receive it. Whether that be through revelation or through our five senses.</li>
                            <li>A common theme with all of the wicked preachers were that they all did not believe in Christ.</li>
                            <li>Teaching that our choices have no consequences is one of the primary tactics of Satan and his followers.</li>
